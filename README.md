Introduction
------------
In this section I am sharing everything related to my learning path in Python. 
I´m  still learning and I´m always looking to practive, all feedback is welcome
#  
- Some of this codes I´ve learned  them over free courses I found on the internet.
- Once I knew Python was the one for me I talked to some friends about it, they were enrolled in https://platzi.com/home
- they gave me access to their account where I started in a learning path in python, back-end and data science.  which boost my skills,  and motivated me to keep going.

- I also did a professional course in Git & GitHub. which opened a huge door for me to access an unkown world of knowledge.

I am still in the process of learning so I will be updating this post to make it better .
